A Verilog Implementation of the AM2900 Family
---------------------------------------------

The Am2900 family of ICs implements various parts of a CPU and makes it possible
to build a bit-slice CPU with relatively few components.

**Note:** this is a work in progress and more tests, modules, and documentation
will be added in the future.
